					I wandered lonely as a cloud<br />
					That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br />
					When all at once I saw a crowd,<br />
					A host of golden daffodils;<br />
					Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br />
					Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br />

				<p class="poem">
					I wandered lonely as a cloud<br />
					That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br />
					When all at once I saw a crowd,<br />
					A host of golden daffodils;<br />
					Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br />
					Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br />
				</p>
				<p class="poem">
					Continuous as the stars that shine<br />
					And twinkle on the Milky Way,<br />
					They stretched in never-ending line<br />
					Along the margin of a bay:<br />
					Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br />
					Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br />
				</p>
				<p class="poem">
					The waves beside them danced; but they<br />
					Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br />
					A poet could not but be gay,<br />
					In such a jocund company:<br />
					I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br />
					What wealth the show to me had brought:<br />
				</p>
				<p class="poem">
					For oft, when on my couch I lie<br />
					In vacant or in pensive mood,<br />
					They flash upon that inward eye<br />
					Which is the bliss of solitude;<br />
					And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br />
					And dances with the daffodils.<br />
