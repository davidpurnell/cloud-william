          I wandered lonely as a cloud<br />
          That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br />
          When all at once I saw a crowd,<br />
          A host of golden daffodils;<br />
          Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br />
          Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br />

          I wandered lonely as a cloud<br />
          That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br />
          When all at once I saw a crowd,<br />
          A host of golden daffodils;<br />
          Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br />
          Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br />
        </p>
        <p class="poem">
          and twinkle on the Milky Way,<br />
          They stretched in never-ending line<br />
          along the margin of a bay:<br />
          Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br />
          tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br />
        </p>
        <p class="poem">
          The waves beside them danced; but they<br />
          Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br />
          A poet could not but be gay,<br />
          in such a jocund company:<br />
          I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br />
          what wealth the show to me had brought:<br />
        </p>
        <p class="poem">
          For oft, when on my couch I lie<br />
          In vacant or in pensive mood,<br />
          They flash upon that inward eye<br />
          Which is the bliss of solitude;<br />
          And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br />
          And dances with the daffodils.<br />
